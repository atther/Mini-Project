Unreserved IRCTC Ticket Booking
This project is for the unreserved railway ticket booking, usually there are two methods to do that:
1.Go train station platform and take your ticket from there.
2.Using IRCTC's UTS mobile app to book the tickets online but the problem with this app is it will ask for  your GPS location because one should be within a 5km range of a train station from where we want to start our journey.
  In first case one have to be in hectic long queue on platform and in second case as discussed earlier the problem of 5km GPS range.
  So the solution for these problems is that we will keep a server(IRCTC) on train station platform, one who want the unreserved ticket can connect this server and he/she will get a pop-up window after succesfully connecting server(IRCTC) and book the instant tickets without being in hectic queues.
  
  * Another thing we can do is, in india every day lot of trains get cancelled and eventually they have to stay at train stations ,passenger looking for accomodation can be accomodated in the trains which were cancelled(this accomodation will be for short period of time) and passenger can be charged accordingly as there preference was AC, non-AC, Sleeper etc...
